# Codebase for the Web Development course

*Initially meant to be just a test link between Atom and GitHub, I've simply used it to keep track of and organize all(most of) my codes for the Web coursework*

**Also check [the link to my code dump repo!](https://github.com/has9h/code-dump)**

# This repo has:

* **Codes for the Web course project**
* Codes for basic HTML, Semantic HTML, CSS, and VanillaJS
