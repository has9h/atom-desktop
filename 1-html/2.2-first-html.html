		<p> <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply <em>dummy text</em> of the printing and typesetting industry.</p> 
		
		<p> <ins>Lorem Ipsum</ins> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>
		
		<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
